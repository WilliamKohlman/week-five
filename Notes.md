# Week 5 Notes

## Things I learned
* The intricacies of .svg versus .png or .jpg
* Inkscape basics such as rotating, importing and swapping palettes, re-sizing, etc.
* How to edit .svg in Inkscape to create a poster
* How to build a Github Site
  * How to add a theme to a site
* How Tile Maps work
* Specifics required to generate a leaflet map using html/css/js
* How to load GeoJson
* How to run a local server using python
* How to use MapWarper
* How to overlay and animate maps with leaflet
* How to use sonification with excel data using TwoTone
* How to use Audacity


## Static Site
No issues setting up a static site, followed the instructions and used my html knowledge to get it set up.



## Posters
Not sure if I used my favourite, but I used a recent highly marked essay written on an exam. If I were to have used one from an actual class and not an exam I would have had to include a references portion, but since this was from an exam booklet, there were no references. 

A random issue I had was that Google Chrome wouldn't let me save .svg so I used microsoft edge which let me. Thought it was weird since Edge is now built on chromium I think.
#### Elements that Worked
The rotation design works to show the passage of time really well and the evolution of the essay.

#### Elements that did not work
Since this essay was focused heavily on explanation, I felt that only images should be in the rotation part, so as to avoid repeating myself. For a truly good poster I should have included bullets listing and describing things as well as expand on them in the outside areas.


## Mapping

The storymapping worked pretty well, I had used something similar in my second year Historian's Craft class but we used a different googlemaps tool I believe. This tool worked well for telling a simple slideshow story.

Wanted to use one of [these maps](https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/CollectionSearch/Pages/record.aspx?app=FonAndCol&IdNumber=4139577) to overlay but I had issues uploading them. Once it uploaded succesfully but wouldn't load the maps to rectify. Then when I tried re-uploading them it had an error: "File Name already in use". Instead I found another map that looked comprehensive and used it. Then when I went back to the instructions I realized it was the same map Dr. Graham had used.

Everything worked smoothly.


## Sonification
Focused on exploring Two Tone and the Roman data that Dr. Graham provided. 

Used a Double Bass in C Major with a 4 octave range with a BPM of 173 for the Count of Coins since it had many low fields which the bass matching well with that.

I used a Glockenspiel in C Major with a 3 octave range with a BPM of 173 for the Count of Other Roman Materials since it had higher fields which the higher sounding instrument matched better with.
